# Common Causes of Segmentation Faults:
# Accessing uninitialized pointers: Using a pointer before it has been assigned a valid memory address.
# Accessing memory out of bounds: Trying to access an array element outside its defined range, or using an invalid index.
# Dereferencing a null pointer: Attempting to access the value stored at a pointer that is null.
# Using dangling pointers: Accessing memory that has been deallocated or is no longer valid.
# Stack overflow: Using up all available stack space, typically due to excessive recursion.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 4;
    int *ptr = &a;
    //print
    cout<<*ptr<<endl;
    //free up space
    ptr = nullptr;
    delete ptr;
    //it gives segmentation fault as we try to access deleted pointer
    cout<<*ptr;
